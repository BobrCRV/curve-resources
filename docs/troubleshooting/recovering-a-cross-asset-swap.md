## **Initiate recovery**

Visit: [https://classic.curve.fi/recover](https://classic.curve.fi/recover)â€‹

Enter your token id found on Etherscan, enter your the token you would like to receive (if your token has sBTC then it must be a Bitcoin token that shares a pool with sBTC, if your token is sUSD, it should be a token that shares a pool with sUSD) and then click recover.

Confirm your transaction and you're done.
