The main purposes of the Curve DAO token are to **incentivise liquidity providers** on the Curve Finance platform as well as to involve as many users as possible in the governance of the protocol.

*Currently, CRV has three main uses:*

- **Rewards**
- **Boosting**
- **Voting**

These three functions will **require users to vote-lock their CRV** and acquire veCRV.

!!!info
    veCRV stands for **vote-escrowed CRV**, representing CRV tokens locked for voting in the Curve DAO.  
    More information about Vote-Locking can be found [here](../governance/vote-locking-boost.md).

# **Rewards (Admin Fees)**

CRV can be locked to receive trading fees from the Curve protocol. A community-led proposal introduced a 50% admin fee on all trading fees. These fees are collected and converted to 3CRV, which are then distributed to veCRV holders.

# **Boosting**

One of the main incentives for locking CRV is the ability to boost rewards on provided liquidity. Vote-locking CRV allows users to acquire voting power to participate in the DAO and earn up to a 2.5x boost on the liquidity they provide on Curve.

# **Voting**

Once CRV holders vote-lock their veCRV, they can start voting on various DAO proposals and pool parameters.
