> Answering all your burning questions about the vote locking boost

## **What is vote locking?**

CRV holders can vote lock their CRV into the Curve DAO to receive veCRV. The longer they lock for, the more veCRV they receive. Vote locking allows you to vote in governance, boost your CRV rewards and receive trading fees.

## **What is the vote locking boost?**

When vote locking CRV, you will also earn a boost on your provided liquidity of up to 2.5x. The goal is to incentivise users to participate in governance by rewarding them with a bigger share of the daily CRV inflation.

## **When does the boost start?**

The boost will start on the 26th of August 2020 around 11pm UTC.

## **What are veCRV?**

veCRV stands for voting escrow CRV. They are your CRV locked for voting. The longer you lock your CRV for, the more voting power you have (and the bigger boost you can reach). You can vote lock 1,000 CRV for a year to have a 250 veCRV weight. Each CRV locked for four years is equal to 1 veCRV.

The number of veCRV you will receive depends on how long you lock your CRV for. The minimum locking time is one week and the maximum locking time is four years.

Your veCRV weight gradually decreases as your escrowed tokens approach their lock expiry. A graph illustrating the decrease can be found at this address: [https://dao.curve.fi/locker](https://dao.curve.fi/locker)​

## **How is your boost calculated?**

To reach your maximum boost of 2.5x, there are several parameters to take into consideration.

## **What if I provide liquidity in multiple pools?**

Your voting power applies to all gauges but may produce different boosts based on how much liquidity you are providing and how much total liquidity the pool has.

## **What happens if more people vote lock?**

If other liquidity providers vote lock more CRV, your boost will stay what it was when you applied it. If you abuse this, another user can kick and force a boost update to take you down to your real boost.

## **How often does my boost records voting power changes?**

Your voting weight decreases over time but your boost will take notice of your decreasing voting power at certain checkpoints like withdrawing, depositing into a gauge or minting CRV.

For example if you start at 1000 veCRV and your voting power decreases to 800 veCRV, your boost will still use your original voting power of 1000 veCRV until a user checkpoint.

## **How can I apply my boost?**

After creating or adding to your lock, you need to click the apply boost button to update your boost on each of the gauge you're providing liquidity in. Your boost can also be updated by depositing or withdrawing from a gauge.
