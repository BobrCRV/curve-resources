## Acquiring Matic to pay for transaction fees

Transaction fees on Matic are very cheap usually costing less than $0.0001 but you'll still need Matic to pay for gas. You can bridge some from Ethereum using the link below:

[Polygon](https://wallet.matic.network/)

## Head to Curve

Once that's done you can also bridge USDC/DAI and deposit and swap on Curve Polygon website making sure you're connected to the Polygon network in your MetaMask settings:
