# **The gauge system**

On Curve Finance, the inflation is going to users who provide liquidity. This usage is measured with gauges. The liquidity gauge measures how much a user is providing in liquidity.

The liquidity gauge measures how many dollars you have provided in a Curve pool. Each Curve pool has its own liquidity gauge where you can stake your liquidity provider tokens

# **The weight system**

For a gauge to be able to receive CRV emissions it has to be added to the GaugeController.
Each gauge also has a weight and a type. Those weights represent how much of the daily CRV inflation will be received by the liquidity gauge.

# **The DAO**

The weight systems allow the Curve DAO to dictate where the CRV inflation should go. You can vote at this address: [https://dao.curve.fi/gaugeweight](https://dao.curve.fi/gaugeweight)â€‹

By doing so, you can put your voting power towards the liquidity gauge (or pool) you think should receive the most CRV.
